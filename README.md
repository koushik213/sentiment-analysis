# Customer Sentiements

In order to better understand how our customers felt about marketing strategies and advertisements in particular, we came up with the Market Affinity feature. This feature will help build our recommendation model and provide targeted recommendations regarding advertising strategies for each of the customer segments. The Market Affinity feature groups the customers into the below 4 categories:

* **High Interest Customers:** These customers are extremely interested in targeted advertising and are actually even willing to pay higher prices for the premium subscription in exchange for personalized recommendations and targeted advertisements. These would ideally be our premium customers who would benefit the most from the premium service.

* **Neutral Customers:** These customers are not really interested or expect targeted advertisements from the service. They do however expect subscription discounts and perks if they are shown advertisements.

* **Disinterested Customers:** They do not wish to see advertisements, be it general or targetted. These customers are even willing to pay a higher price just so that they can avoid advertisements. We would have to come up with tailored recommendations to make sure the disinterested customer sentiments are taken into account in our new product. 

* **Unfavorable:** Customers under this group have strong opinions about advertisements and are completely unwilling to share any personal information for targeted advertisements or recommendations. They view advertising as a medium for privacy threats and identity theft.

# Findings and Insights
Based on the model selection and evaluation, we have listed our findings and formulated the below recommendations for each of our 4 customer segments. The premium service we are proposing will be built surrounding these findings and recommendations. We believe these recommendations will help build a premium service which meets the different customer segments advertising requirements and provides top customer value.

Overall we see that 46% of the surveyed population do not welcome targeted advertisements.

* **High Interest Customers:** Majority of these customers are millennials and GenZ and consume their media on television and portable devices. A lot of their television watch time is spent consuming some form of content on other devices. Since these consumers spend a lot of time on social media and entertainment applications, we recommend that marketing surveys are sent to these customers over social media. The results will help base our premium serviceâ€™s personalized recommendations and advertisements for them.

* **Neutral Customers:** These consumers are again majorly millennials and GenZ and have lower incomes (probably as they are students) . They primarily binge watch their media content. Since they comprise the younger population who are open to ads if they pay a lower price, our strategy to this segment would be to provide student discounts or various offers on completing the marketing surveys over social media.

* **Disinterested Customers:** These are millennials and GenZ who spend a lot of time on portable devices for entertainment, social-media and occasionally binge on shows and consume media on television. Since they have a high willingness to pay for ad-free premium services, our strategy is to provide personalized content recommendations and banner ads on social media or television.

* **Unfavorable:** These are the Boomers & Gen-X population who mostly only use their mobile phones for essentials and productivity tasks. They own and consume media through television and the computer and are not active users on social media. Our primary marketing strategy for this group is to have awareness based advertisements on the television.
